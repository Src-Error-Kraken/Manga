USER STORIES
    Zack a New York otaku loves to watch animes on sites like KissAnime, Funitation, and Okiniiri-Anime. He wants to get         into reading the graphic novels otherwise known as Mangas, especially beause the mangas usually contain more about the       Animes he likes then the actual animations. On his favorite anime website Okiniiri-Anime he sees a link to its sister
    site "Besuto-manga" where he falls in love immediately after reading the lastest chapter of "I can't understand what my     husband is saying".
